Zariye tharo, khil gayo saaro jag,

Thare bina bhi, mhane lagge tu hai,
Har saans ma bas tharo nasha sa hai.

Probably friends, possibly lovers but definitely not nothing .
Those were the three thoughts in my mind for the first time when your path crossed mine ,
When I saw those eyes for the very first time ...
Then I learned your favourite color, 
the shade of your skies,
The way you laugh, the warmth in goodbyes.
Witnessed how you painted a smile on my usual frown, Turned all my silences gently around....
I started practicing learning you , thinking about you a little too much in my spare time .
Then the three thoughts started to rearrange :
Probably lovers, possibly friends but definitely not nothing .


We know the heart‚Äôs a muscle - and like all,
It learns, it remembers the touch, the ache, the yearns.
An unconscious echo, a silent decree,
To repeat the rhythm it's come to believe.
And now, my heart - it knows only you,
It beats in the pattern of things that you do.
It knows how you breathe in the still of the night,
The laughter that flickers like soft candlelight.
It hears your socks on the tiles at dawn,
knows the look on your face when your focus is drawn.
It memorized the sighs that you never quite speak,
The way your smile warms the curve of your cheek.
It‚Äôs learned the breath from your lips when you're near , And the brave little shiver when you fight back a tear.
In the network of veins where emotions hide,
Your every expression now lives deep, stuck inside.
So when I say my heart knows you - I mean, truly it does, Like it's known you a thousand years - or perhaps it was...


Maybe we're still somewhere in between ,
Not quite defined, yet deeply seen.
But if love is a rhythm - my heart keeps true ,
Then mine beats steady -  in time with you .
Call it what you will, but this much is true :
You'll never be nothing - you'll always be you...</i>

      <div class="letter-content"><i>
On a chalky first day, I walked through the door,
Eyes full of wonder, heart unsure.
Among strangers ,
You saw me ‚Äî and my world tilted right.

But fate, with its quiet, cruel disguise,
Had wrapped my heart in someone else‚Äôs ties.
So you tucked your crush beneath your chest,
Buried it gently where silence rests.

You told yourself stories that blurred my face,
Painted your longing in another place.
Gaslit your heart to guard the ache,
Afraid the truth might tear it up.... might make it break.

But the universe is patient, and chemistry knows,
That love, once sparked, quietly grows.
In labs with beakers and burning flame,
Our glances sparked what we couldn't name.
The air was thick with things unsaid,
With dreams we shelved and words we fled.

Then came the season of sacred lights,
Maa Durga danced through Kolkata nights.
Crowds roared and cymbals rang ‚Äî
But all I heard was your laugh, your name.

You reached for my hand, so unsure, so unplanned,
And time collapsed in that single strand.
My breath paused, my heart did too ‚Äî
The world fell away ‚Äî there was only you.

Still, I waited ‚Äî exams, goodbyes,
The silence stitched with unsent replies.
Until, like spring through winter‚Äôs frost,
I texted you ‚Äî and nothing was lost.

We picked up threads never truly torn,
Two old souls, once classmates ,
Now, newly reborn as everything.
From poems shared to hearts unveiled,
From late-night talks where laughter sailed.

You, the girl who once had to hide her feelings,
Now walk beside me, arms open wide.
No secrets left, no silent pain,
Just love that pours like monsoon rain.

And now, each second with you feels new,
A thousand lifetimes overdue.
I see you now ‚Äî not just as you are,
But all you were, from near to far.

"The girl whose eyes made space jealous ‚Äî brighter than the Helix Nebula, softer than any star I‚Äôd ever wish upon."
The quiet chemist of fate and fire,
The heartbeat behind my deepest desire.

So here we are ‚Äî no more pretend,
No false beginnings, just love without end.
You were never a maybe, never a guess ‚Äî
You were my always, hidden in less.

And if they ask where our story began,
I‚Äôll smile and gently take your hand:
"In a class full of strangers, you first saw me...
And the rest ‚Äî was always meant to be."</i>
